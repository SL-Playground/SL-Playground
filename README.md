SL playground was made at Devhouse’24 for the deaf  and dumb community. Its major focus is on Indian deaf and dumb community.
It is aimed at easing the communication between a person who doesn’t understands sign language and a person who can only communicate via sign language.
This project has its existence due to a sole reason that there are almost 60cr+ people with this disability and there’s no one to cater to there issue at a deep level.
The basis of this project is backed by the strong machine learning models with an average accuracy >65. 

Important features 

1)It works in real time 

2)It incorporates parallel programming to streamline the function of camera feed and modal predictions.

3)It teaches the beginners from the scratch about the basic ASL symbols (A-Z) with easy quizzes

4)It has an elegant UI which clearly classifies between the two models which is ASL and  ISL 

5)In ASL part we have  incorporated text to speech at live feed , the voice will come just with the predictions

6)We have also introduced the multilingual support for our code which includes almost all the languages out there be it Japanese or English or Chinese or german.
